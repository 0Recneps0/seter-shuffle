# run.sh (SeTeR Shuffle, Python experimental core)
#
# Wires the pieces together: AppleScript bridge -> Python core -> bridge.
# The Python core never touches Music; the bridge never decides an
# order. Previews never call the apply script at all.
#
# Usage (from this directory):
#   ./run.sh audit                  tag-coverage audit, change nothing
#   ./run.sh flowPreview            print the would-be Flow order, change nothing
#   ./run.sh flow                   build/refresh "SeTeR Flow"
#   ./run.sh shuffle [playlist]     shuffle a playlist in place, or the
#                                   whole library into "SeTeR Shuffle"
#   ./run.sh rediscover-preview     print Rediscover picks, change nothing
#   ./run.sh rediscover             refresh "SeTeR Rediscover" and record
#                                   history ONLY after a successful apply
#   ./run.sh undo <playlist>        restore a playlist from its last backup
#   ./run.sh probe                  measure this Mac's playlist order
#                                   direction on a 3-song probe playlist
#                                   (created and deleted by the probe),
#                                   change nothing else
#   ./run.sh probe-keep             like probe, but LEAVE the probe
#                                   playlist in place so its on-screen
#                                   order in Music can be eyeballed
#                                   against the probe verdict, then
#                                   delete it in Music when done
#
# ORDER DIRECTION (2026-10-28 failure): duplicating tracks into a
# playlist can land them in reverse order on a Mac, or the
# every-track read can be reversed; the .4 bridge guessed neither
# and failed verification in a loop on a real 806-song playlist.
# Every apply and undo below therefore probes FIRST (probe_mode):
# the probe creates a 3-song playlist, duplicates in a known order,
# reads it back by list, by track index, and by position, and reports
# one of forward / insert-reversed / read-reversed, or ambiguous.
# An ambiguous or failed probe aborts the run with the real playlist
# untouched. The mode is then passed to apply/undo, which build and
# verify with it (see bridge/probe-order.applescript and
# seter_shuffle/order_direction.py). There is no flip-on-failure
# fallback anywhere in the normal flow.
#
# State lives under ~/Library/Logs/seter-shuffle-python/ on the Mac:
# dumps, orders, backups, and the run log. Nothing here touches the
# stable AppleScript install (~/Documents/SeTeRShuffle) or its launchd
# job. This is opt-in experimental only.
#
# Safety wiring (see BRIDGE-SAFETY.md for the full contract):
#  * Every step runs through step(), which logs GATE OK / GATE FAILED
#    and stops the run on failure. No step can silently continue
#    after a failed step, and both stdout AND stderr go to the log,
#    so a failure leaves evidence of which gate fired.
#  * An order is validated (validate-order) after the core computes
#    it and before the bridge ever runs: empty, duplicate,
#    missing-ID, truncated, or wrong-count orders are refused while
#    the playlist is still untouched.
#  * Before an apply, any previous backup is preserved as
#    <backup>.prev and the backup path is cleared, so a stale backup
#    can never be mistaken for this run's fresh backup. If the apply
#    then fails AND a fresh backup exists, the runner attempts a
#    restore from it via undo before exiting non-zero. If no fresh
#    backup exists, the apply failed before any playlist change, and
#    the log says so instead of restoring from a stale file.
#  * Backup filenames include a hash of the playlist name, so two
#    playlists whose names differ only by spaces and slashes can no
#    longer share a backup file (an old quirk: the old names were
#    sanitized only). Backup files from before this change still
#    exist under their old names and can be used by calling
#    undo.applescript directly with that file.
#  * Rediscover history is recorded ONLY after a successful apply,
#    so a failed apply never burns a song's cooldown.
